Here’s a shorter, crisper version in the first person:

1. **Identifying and Solving Problems**: 
   - I identified key issues with existing LLM solutions (e.g., handling tabular data) and optimized the **SE Data Visualization tool** based on root cause analysis.

2. **Leveraging Data**:
   - I used comprehensive feedback from **Devin Lab** and real-time performance data to make data-driven decisions, improving the tool’s effectiveness.

3. **Sound Judgment**:
   - In the **Auto Code Rover** evaluation, I compared my in-house model with open-source LLMs, weighing the pros and cons to determine the best solution.

4. **Continuous Learning**:
   - I actively sought new approaches for optimizing models, applying what I learned from **Samsung PRISM** to improve performance and adapt to challenges.

5. **Collaboration and Escalation**:
   - I engaged engineers and students in problem-solving during **Devin Lab** and knew when to escalate issues to ensure they were tackled effectively.

This is concise and highlights your key achievements aligned with the behavior indicators.
