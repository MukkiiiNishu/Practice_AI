Goal -->> POC 1 [SE Data Visualization]

Hi I need your help , actually i have to submit my Perfromance Evaluation. my Goal was to create a complete POC. I had worked on "https://github.com/microsoft/lida" and i have completely understand the requiremnets of the tool , the performance of the tool , how it work ,and created a similar in house tool names SE for Data Visualization [~Lida] which was compeltely a POC based on the LIDA architecture , i had even deployed the tool for RPA Team and SE BOT Team , I had created its web UI and also created the API endpoints which they can directly interact and get the result on there system. I want you to read more about this in the github link which i shared and come up with the points i need to add in my performance evaluation to get the full points. I request you to sounds very technical and also It should be high level ,it should  be customized and in bullet points and proper paragraph structure . I hope you know how to put the things in Performance evaluation in the Companies
